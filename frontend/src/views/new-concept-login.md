# App Background
- Dot Matrix background that glows around a feathered radius around the mouse whenever the mouse moves (maybe App level? Optimized?)
- On login page landing, quick fade in, contracting login border to the existing centered rectangle
- Login Container has a more prominent glow or drop shadow
- Login button on click (or demo buttons) expands the login container to the edges of the window to fade/transition into the main app
- Respects the dark and light themes. When Light theme, inverse dark glow and vice versa
- Extract to reusable components in case we want to add similar mouse events to component cards that have the background gradient effect
